SPECIFIC RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONS

1.	DECODING MOTOR TASKS (EXECUTION AND IMAGERY) FROM EEG-BASED BCI (SENSOR SPACE ANALYSIS)

•	Vinod and his research team has proposed robust and accurate signal processing algorithms to extract discriminative brain activation patterns during hand and foot movement (actual movement execution and motor imagery) using sensor (scalp) signal analysis in an Electroencephalograph (EEG)-based BCI system. They investigated the intra subject and inter subject spectral variability of discriminative motor imagery (movement imagination) patterns in EEG (IEEE EMBC 2008). As motor imagery (MI) tasks are subject-specific, his work showed that the selection of subject-specific discriminative frequency components plays a vital role in distinguishing various MI patterns (IEEE ISCAS 2010). Vinod and his team proposed a novel discriminative filter bank common spatial pattern algorithm to extract subject-specific filter bank for MI classification, which offered error rate reductions of 17.42% and 8.9% for BCI competition datasets III and IV, respectively, compared to the performance offered by the state-of-the-art filter bank-based method (IEEE ISCAS 2009, IEEE TBME 2009). Further, his team proposed a new method to estimate the discriminative frequency components associated with MI of various subjects using the Fisher criterion and investigated the variability of these discriminative frequency components over multiple sessions of EEG recording. Observing the variability of DFC over sessions in the analysis, a new BMI approach called the Adaptively Weighted Spectral-Spatial Patterns algorithm has been proposed. The non-stationary features of EEG signals were adaptively estimated in the proposed algorithms and the results achieved indicated that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and highlights the necessity of efficient frequency band selection techniques in real time motor imagery Brain Computer Interface (BCI) applications (JNE 2011).

•	To obtain high classification accuracy of MI, conventional EEG based BCI employ a large number of scalp electrodes. However, this is inconvenient in the clinical scenarios where preparation time is of paramount importance. To address this problem, Vinod and his student proposed a channel selection method which utilizes a priori information of the MI task and iteratively optimizes the number of relevant channels, thereby improving the classification accuracy (IEEE SMC 2014-1). The proposed method results in better accuracy than state-of-the-art methods with a significant reduction in the number of channels. The paper based on this work has won the BEST STUDENT PAPER AWARD IN IEEE SMC 2014, San Diego, USA.

Further, a new EEG channel selection method based on autoencoder was proposed to reduce the dimension of EEG for MI-BCI. This technique achieved improved motor imagery classification accuracy when the dimension of the data was almost reduced by half compared to the state-of art Filter bank Common Spatial Pattern. The average classification accuracy obtained is 74.3±8.06 % with only 13 encoded channels (IEEE SMC 2019). The significance of this study which extends the use of autoencoder neural networks in motor imagery based BCI is that, it shows substantial improvement in performance with reduced data dimension.

•	A novel, neuro-physiologically inspired convolutional neural network (CNN) named Filter-Bank Convolutional Network (FBCNet) was proposed for MI classification in our work (IEEE SMC 2020). Capturing neurophysiological signatures of MI, FBCNet first creates a multi-view representation of the data by bandpass-filtering the EEG into multiple frequency bands. Next, spatially discriminative patterns for each view are learned using a CNN layer. Finally, the temporal information is aggregated using a new variance layer and a fully connected layer classifies the resultant features into MI classes. We evaluated the performance of FBCNet on a publicly available dataset from Korea University for classification of left vs right hand MI in a subject-specific 10-fold cross-validation setting. Results showed that FBCNet achieves more than 6.7% higher accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art deep learning architectures while requiring less than 1% of the learning parameters.

•	One of the major applications of BCI is in the rehabilitation of patients with neuromuscular disorders, who are incapable of limb movement. However, the limited number of control commands available pose challenges in real-world applications. Most of the BCIs that studied movement-related features use brain signals during movement of different body parts such as right hand, left hand, foot, and tongue. The identification of brain signal components responsible for movement parameters such as speed, direction or extent of hand movement is a challenging area of research. Vinod’s work addressed the research problem of decoding hand movement kinematics (both executed and imagined movements) from EEG. He and his team proposed algorithms for demonstrating the presence of movement parameter information in specific space, frequency and time locations of EEG (IEEE IJCNN 2012) and have developed feature extraction tools to detect them (IEEE SMC 2013). Significant contributions were made in binary classification of hand movement speed and direction (IEEE TBME 2013). The proposed algorithms were modified further to achieve multiclass classification of direction and continuous reconstruction of hand movement speed and trajectory (JNE 2013, IEEE SMC 2015-1). Vinod and his team also proposed an algorithm to decode the speed of hand movement execution using temporal features of EEG (IEEE EMBS-NE 2017).

•	Amplitude based feature extraction techniques have been used by researchers to study motor activity of upper limbs whereas phase synchrony, used to estimate functional relationship between signals, has rarely been used to study single hand movements in different directions. Vinod and his student proposed a novel phase-locking-based feature extraction method, called wavelet phase-locking value (W-PLV), to analyse synchronous EEG channel-pairs and classify hand movement directions (IEEE SMC 2017-1). The proposed W-PLV based method achieved a mean binary classification accuracy of 76.85%. The significance of this work is that, it presented a thorough analysis of the phase-locking patterns extracted from EEG corresponding to hand movements in different directions using W-PLV across various wavelet levels and verified their discriminative ability in the single trial binary classification of hand movement directions (JNE Dec 2018-1).

•	Another significant contribution of Vinod and his team is the study investigating vital factors in efficient and robust Sensory Motor Rhythm BCI (SMR-BCI) design. Based on this study, his team proposed algorithms that address subject-variability of optimal features and neurophysiological factors that correlate with BCI performance. A novel strategy to further optimize BCI performance by taking into account the variability of discriminative spectral regions across various EEG channels is proposed (JNE Dec 2018-2). Further, this work demonstrated the effective prediction of SMR-BCI performance with physiological indicators derived from multi-channel resting-state EEG. The significance of this work is that it implies the need for subject-specific modelling of BCI and the prediction of BCI performance using multi-channel rest-state parameters, to ensure enhanced BCI performance.

•	A very recent work investigated the brain activation modulations elicited by imagined movement directions and the EEG features that characterize them (IEEE THMS April 2021). An experiment was conducted in which 10 subjects imagined 2D right-hand movement in the left, right, up and down directions in the vertical plane. The frequency and phase characteristics of EEG rhythms are explored to identify the features that discriminate movement imagination towards multiple directions. The proposed decoding step consists of Fisher’s analysis of instantaneous phase values to identify EEG channels with optimal discriminative information followed by extraction of phase-locking values and temporal-spatial features, which are then used for classification. The proposed approach offered significantly higher (p < 0.05) performance than the state-of-the art method while employing subject-specific time segments and channels. An average accuracy of 69.25% was obtained for binary classification of all pairs of movement directions with a performance increment of 8.33% compared to the conventional approaches using fixed channel-time paradigm. The results illustrate the potential use of non-invasive EEG signals in decoding imagined movement kinematics, and further research is needed to investigate and optimize the separability of multiple directions.

•	Error processing in the human brain is characterized by a distinct neural response that is elicited when the outcome of an event is not the same as expected. This response is known as error-related potential (ErrP). Detection of error-related potentials from a single-trial data can lead the existing Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems one step closer to autonomous system. The non-stationarity of the Electroencephalograph (EEG) signal along with poor spatial resolution and low signal-to-noise ratio make the task of detecting ErrP on a single-trial basis challenging. The ErrP dataset recorded using EEG will contain both erroneous and correct actions. A classifier such as the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) can be trained to identify the erroneous versus correct action from a single trial EEG data. However, the classifier will have large number of parameters to be learned, and typically, the ErrP dataset is unbalanced with smaller number of erroneous trials. Therefore, the trained classifier may not generalize the data well. To classify the ErrP with better accuracy, an ANN architecture is proposed by us (IEEE iCAST 2020). Learning the parameters of the ANN was carried out in two stages (Stage-1 and Stage-2) in the proposed method. The first stage of learning will have relatively large feature samples collected from several subjects. The first stage learning is aimed to capture the global characteristics of the ErrP. In the second stage, the pre-trained ANN classifier from the first stage is tuned for each subject. The ErrP dataset has two sessions dataset recorded from six subjects and the Stage-1 and Stage-2 training models are cross-validated. The overall classification accuracy achieved after cross-validation is 74.78 ± 3.43% and 86.03 ± 1.02% for erroneous and correct trials respectively. The improvement in the classification accuracy achieved is 12.67% and 15.51% for erroneous and correct trials respectively compared with the existing statistical classifier method. The method proposed shows an efficient way to train ANN classifier to achieve higher classification accuracy for unbalanced and smaller dataset such as ErrP.

•	A novel ErrP detection method based on temporal domain features of ErrP, particularly, the standard deviation measure, has been proposed recently (BSPC May 2021). The difference in the standard deviation between the correct and the erroneous trials is verified using a statistical test and this information is subsequently used for ErrP detection. In the proposed method, the EEG electrodes from the frontocentral region of the brain are ranked using standard deviation based ranking criterion and a few top-ranked electrodes will be considered for single-trial detection of ErrP. Then, a modified power-law based transformation is proposed to enhance the discriminability between the correct and error trials. The proposed transformation increases the discriminability between the erroneous and correct trials and achieves the best trade-off between the sensitivity and the specificity for detecting ErrP on single-trial basis compared to existing methods.

•	Single-trial detection of ErrP from EEG data is challenging. We proposed an efficient method for selecting electrodes that carry ErrP related information to enhance single-trial detection accuracy (IEEE BioSMART 2021-3). In this work, the cosine similarity and Euclidian distance measures were used to rank the EEG electrodes. The selected top-ranked electrodes were used to extract electrode-average features followed by a classifier. The two proposed electrode ranking methods - cosine similarity measure and Euclidian distance measure were implemented separately. Both electrode ranking methods aided in achieving equally good ErrP detection rates. The cross-validated average detection rates achieved using the proposed electrode ranking methods are ~73.5% and ~80% for error and correct trials respectively. Further, the results are compared with three existing methods including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented on the same dataset used in this work to show the efficiency of the proposed method. The significance of this work is that the single-trial detection of ErrP can aid in improving the classification accuracy of decoding EEG tasks in Brain-Computer Interface systems.

•	A very recent work decodes the left vs. right directional information from the MI of dominant hand movement using EEG-based BCI (BSPC October 2021). The proposed method employs CSP and its variants as features to decode imagined bidirectional hand movements. The direction discriminability of these features are enhanced using the regularisation technique. Spatial regularisation based on electrode positions is also incorporated for comparison. The regularisation methods are applied on overlapped frequency bands and the results are compared. The classifications of extracted features are done using 5-fold cross validation and Linear Discriminant Analysis. The study on 15 healthy subjects shows that filter bank-based spatially regularized CSP method (FBSRCSP) offers the highest average classification accuracy of 90% for decoding bidirectional motor imagery of hand movement. This is a substantial improvement in classification accuracy by 26.3% compared to the best method reported in literature on the same dataset.

•	Our work (BSPC April 2022) decodes two-directional (left versus right direction) motor imagery hand movement using Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCI. To improve the direction decoding accuracy during an online session, this work proposed an additional corrective step using Error-Related Potential (ErrP). During the online session, the trained direction decoding model uses segmented MI trials as input, and the decoded outcome is shown in real-time as feedback. The brain response to feedback shown is used to detect the presence of ErrP using a trained ErrP detection model. If the ErrP is detected, the outcome of the direction decoding model is automatically corrected, which offers an improvement in the performance of the BCI system. Study on 14 healthy subjects showed that the motor imagery direction classification accuracy is improved by 10% compared to the scheme without the ErrP detection model.

•	We investigated the EEG correlates of direction parameters of a center-out hand movement imagination task in right and left directions (IEEE BioSMART 2021-1). A variance-based time bin selection algorithm was proposed to select the most discriminative EEG time segment for directional classification of movement imagination. The discriminative EEG features carrying motor imagery (MI) directional information were extracted from the selected EEG time segment using the wavelet-common spatial pattern (WCSP) algorithm. The WCSP features were classified using Support Vector Machine classifier resulting in a cross validated classification accuracy of 71% between left versus right MI directions of 15 subjects.

•	We used the phase-related feature known as Wavelet-Phase Locking Value (W-PLV) to decode the hand motor imagery direction on calibration session data of 20 healthy subjects (IEEE SMC 2021). Further, an online session was conducted on 13 subjects that used the trained model from the calibration session to decode imagined movement direction. The average classification accuracy achieved on calibration and online session data using phase related features (W-PLV) is 64. 39 ± 4. 23% and 58. 67 ± 4. 06%, respectively. The phase related features (W-PLV) achieved an improvement of 4. 82% and 3. 04% on calibration and online sessions, respectively compared to the amplitude related features alone. Online decoding of user’s intentions such as direction can aid in achieving more natural control of a BCI system.


2.	DECODING MOTOR EXECUTION DIRECTIONS FROM EEG SOURCE SPACE ANALYSIS

•	The conventional practice of decoding motor movement intentions from scalp EEG only reveals certain limited information about the complex tasks of movement with a higher degree of freedom. To overcome this limitation, Vinod investigated the effectiveness of source-space EEG in extracting relevant features that discriminate arm movement in multiple directions. Conventional methods to analyse EEG based motor imagery tasks do not give sufficient information about the ‘moment’ of movement imagination within a single trial. Vinod and his team tackled this limitation by using source localization approach to detect the activation of cortical sources that are responsible for the movement imagination in single trial motor imagery (IEEE SMC 2015-2). The team team proposed a novel source-space feature extraction technique based on supervised locality sensitive Factor analysis which approximates the neurophysiological functioning of the experimental data in a better way than that of a solely data-driven approach. By transforming EEG recordings in the sensor space into source space using a Weighted Minimum Norm Estimate method, this study showed that for a multi-class classification problem of classifying the EEG of voluntary arm movement in 4 orthogonal directions, the source space features offer a significant improvement in the classification accuracy compared to sensor space features (IEEE SMC 2016-1). Further, using Fisher’s Linear Discriminant (FLD) classifier with the One-versus-rest approach, it was demonstrated that for a multi-direction hand movement classification problem, the source space features can result in an increase of over 10% accuracy compared to sensor space features (IEEE EMBC 2016). 

•	Another notable contribution in this direction is the method proposed for discriminating features by modifying classical unsupervised factor analysis to a supervised approach by embedding class-wise label information (JNE Aug 2017). This method emphasizes the cortical source distribution inferred from standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) inverse modeling, which provides more information about the neurophysiological aspects of hand movement in four orthogonal directions. The significance of this study is that, it presents evidence that low-frequency components in the source space play an important role in movement kinematics, and thus it may lead to new strategies for BCI-based neurorehabilitation.

3.	REAL-TIME SUBJECT-INDEPENDENT PATTERN CLASSIFICATION OF OVERT AND COVERT MOVEMENTS FROM fNIRS

•	Vinod with his team developed and tested a real-time method for subject-specific and subject-independent classification of multichannel functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals using support-vector machines (SVM). Left versus right hand movement execution and movement imagery were used as study paradigms in a series of experiments. In the first two experiments, activations in the motor cortex during movement execution and movement imagery were used to develop subject-dependent models that obtained high classification accuracies thereby indicating the robustness of proposed classification method. In the third experiment, a generalized classifier-model was developed from the first two experimental data, which was then applied for subject-independent neurofeedback training. Application of this method in new participants showed mean classification accuracy of 63% for movement imagery tasks and 80% for movement execution tasks (PLOS ONE 2016). This study demonstrated that SVM based rea-time subject-independent classification of fNIRS signals is feasible. The significance of this method is that it has important applications in the field of hemodynamic BCIs, and neuro-rehabilitation where patients can be trained to learn spatio-temporal patterns of healthy brain activity.

4.	BCI-BASED STROKE REHABILITATION (CLINICAL COLLABORATION)

•	Vinod and his co-workers developed novel BCI-based robotic rehabilitation systems and conducted clinical studies in collaboration with hospitals. They investigated the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on the motor-imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) performance of stroke patients. An ensemble method for feature extraction has been proposed that combines shrinkage regularized Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) features from the sensor-space and the cortical source-space Electroencephalography (EEG) across ten rehabilitation sessions (IEEE SMC 2017-2). The classification results of MI vs. Idle state in stroke patients showed that the concatenated features from both the sensor- and source space EEG provided an average cross-validation accuracy of 64.5% which is statistically significant (p<0.001) compared to either using source or sensor-space features. The findings in this work suggest that the effect of tDCS on the stroke recovery is pronounced in subjects whose delta and alpha band power during the post-tDCS intervention is significantly higher as compared to before intervention. The significance of this study is that it paves a new way to analyze the neural correlates of the MI-BCI performance for stroke rehabilitation. 
•	With the availability of multiple rehabilitative interventions, identifying the one that elicits the best motor outcome based on the unique neuro-clinical profile of the stroke survivor is a challenging task. Predicting the potential of recovery using biomarkers specific to an intervention hence becomes important. To address this, Vinod and his team including collaborators from the National University Hospital Singapore investigated the neurological changes in the brain activity of chronic stroke patients undergoing different types of motor rehabilitative interventions and their relationship with the clinical recovery using the Quantitative Electroencephalography (QEEG) features (IEEE EMBC 2018). This paper was selected as the Top-10 EMBS Student Paper Competition Finalist in EMBC 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA. Further, they investigated intervention-specific prognostic and monitory biomarkers of motor function improvements using QEEG features in chronic stroke patients following two different upper extremity rehabilitative interventions viz. Brain-computer interface (BCI) and transcranial direct current stimulation coupled BCI (tDCS-BCI). The statistically significant between-intervention differences observed in the predictive capabilities of these features suggest that intervention-specific biomarkers can be identified (IEEE TNSRE Aug 2019). The significance of this this work is that it can be further pursued to distinctly predict the expected response of a patient to available interventions. The intervention with the highest predicted gains may then be recommended to the patient, thereby enabling a personalized rehabilitation regime. 

•	A novel, neurophysiologically inspired Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) named Filter Bank Convolutional Network (FBCNet) for end-to-end MI classification from EEG data of Chronic Stroke Patients was proposed by Vinod and his team including collaborator from Tan Tock Seng Hospital Singapore. The FBCNet is specifically designed to effectively capture the characteristic EEG activation patterns associated with MI known as Sensory-Motor Rhythms (SMR). With almost 8% higher classification accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, this work showed that incorporation of the neurophysiological priors in the design of deep learning architectures, as done in FBCNet, can lead to significantly more accurate BCI systems (8th International BCI Meeting 2021).

•	Another recent work (IEEE TNSRE Nov 2020) conducted in clinical collaboration with National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore, India, analyzed MI-based brain cortical activity from EEG signals and decoded the imagined hand movement directions in stroke patients. The decoded direction (left vs. right) of hand movement imagination is used to provide control commands to a motorized arm support on which patient’s affected (paralyzed) arm is placed. This enables the patient to move his/her stroke affected hand towards the intended (imagined) direction that aids neuroplasticity in the brain. An average Motor Imagery (MI) direction classification accuracy of 74.44% is obtained in performing the training protocol and 68.63% from the prediction protocol during feedback session on 16 stroke patients. The significance of this study is that it is the first published work that reports decoding of MI hand movement directions of stroke patients using noninvasive EEG-based BCI.

5.	BCI FOR COGNITIVE ENHANCEMENT

•	Vinod and his team developed several computer games that exploit the possibilities of BCI in entertainment and cognitive skill enhancement. His work demonstrated that Neurofeedback, the self-regulation of brain signals recorded using EEG, allows BCI users to enhance cognitive as well as motor functions using specific training strategies. Vinod investigated the impact of a neurofeedback-based BCI game controlled by player’s attention-related EEG signal, on the enhancement of attention and cognitive skills of healthy subjects. The experimental analysis of player’s attention level (measured by entropy values of EEG) and the comparison of cognitive test results demonstrated the benefits of practicing BCI based neurofeedback game in the enhancement of attention/cognitive skills (IEEE EMBS NER 2013).

•	Proposed a game protocol in which the player memorizes a set of numbers in a matrix, and to correctly fill the matrix using his attention score computed using sample entropy features of EEG (IEEE EMBC 2013). The statistically significant performance improvement of game players after playing a number of game sessions demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed game in enhancing their concentration and memory skills.

•	Investigated the feasibility of employing EEG features related to sustained attention and overt visual attention-shift towards left or right visual periphery from a fixation point in the context of a neurofeedback game. The neurofeedback game enabled players to select the targets solely by EEG features related to overt visual attention, offering an average accuracy of 72.22% (IEEE SMC 2014-2).

•	Developed a multi-player video game in 3-D environment controlled by EEG features related to three different levels of attention. A number of conventional control mechanisms present in commercial games such as keyboard strokes have also been integrated in the game. Experimental results revealed the feasibility of integrating brain signal based inputs along with conventional control inputs in the context of multi-player neurofeedback games for improving brain functions (IEEE SMC 2014-3).

•	Developed an EEG driven gaming interface where the player has to push a virtual ball from one end of game’s graphical user interface to the other end using his attention level. Attention level of the player is quantified using the ratio of theta to beta band power in EEG signals. The experimental analysis showed that the proposed game is capable of enhancing player’s attention skill as well as enhances the ability of the player to sustain attention for longer duration (IEEE SMC 2014-4). This “ball game” can be effectively used in neurofeedback training for attention deficit children.

•	Studied the impact of neurofeedback in the context of a simple computer game controlled by attention-based EEG. A comparative study using a single neurofeedback group and two control groups conducted to examine the impact of neurofeedback on enhancing attention score and cognitive skill explicitly demonstrated the significance and usefulness of neurofeedback in EEG based games (IEEE SMC 2016-2).

•	Our recent study (BSPC July 2021-1) reveals the occurrence of a distinct long-latency AEP around 1.5 s for own-name stimulus and a higher discrimination ability of participants in discarding non-self-referential stimuli (familiar-name) compared to self-referential stimuli (own-name). The method can be applied for the off-line analysis of own-name AEPs to diagnose mild cognitive impairments and also developmental disorders like autism.

6.	BCI-BASED COGNTIVE BIOMETRIC IDENTIFICATION

•	Vinod and his team conducted extensive work on developing person identification and authentication systems using BCI-based cognitive biometrics. The team analyzed the efficacy of the complexity of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorded during rest state for recognizing individuals from a publicly available EEG dataset consisting of 109 subjects (IEEE SMC 2016-3). Based on a Mahalanobis distance-based classifier, EEG beta band entropy computed from 64 channels offered an average correct recognition rate of 98.31%.

•	Proposed a biometric identification system combining subject-specific EEG alpha peak frequency, peak power and delta band power values to form discriminative feature vectors and templates. A public dataset of EEG signals recorded from 109 healthy subjects during eyes open/closed (EO/EC) relaxed rest states, has been analyzed here. An average recognition rate of up to 90 % is achieved, by combining spectral features from delta and alpha bands extracted from selected 19 EEG channels recorded from 109 healthy subjects during eyes open/closed (EO/EC) relaxed rest states (IEEE SMC 2016-4). Experimental results explicitly showed the usefulness of combining subject-specific alpha and delta bands in future biometric recognition systems. 

•	Proposed an EEG-based biometric authentication system employing power spectral density features extracted from alpha, beta and gamma bands of 14-channel EEG in response to a number of visual or auditory stimuli by seeing/hearing self, familiar and unfamiliar faces/voices. The proposed system offered an overall accuracy of 79.73% with a false acceptance rate (FAR) of 13.91% and false rejection rate (FRR) of 26.6% (IEEE IECBES 2016).

•	Proposed an online biometric authentication framework using EEG from 14 channels and conducted a number of client and imposter authentication tests that offered an average recognition rate of 88.33% (ACM ICCSP 2017). Experimental analysis showed the subject-specificity of distinct bands and features, and highlights the utility of subject-specific band power features in EEG-based biometric systems.

•	Proposed an online EEG-based biometric system which utilizes the activations of brain towards a set of subject-specific self-referential visual stimuli. The stimuli set consist of a number of self-face images and that of subject’s relatives, which are expected to elicit brain activity in a subject-specific manner. The subject-specific biometric marker used in the proposed authentication system is the relative spectral activity of left and right hemisphere EEG in various frequency bands. Experimental analysis revealed utility of alpha and beta bands for the proposed approach, offering an average biometric recognition accuracy of 87.50% (IEEE SMC 2017-3).

•	Employed a novel mind relaxation metric to determine the optimum epochs from EEG for the classification and verification that offered classification accuracy in the range of 97–99% based on a single EEG channel. The results demonstrated that it is possible to move towards a single-channel biometric identification system with a very high level of reliability and accuracy (IET Biometrics 2017).

•	Proposed an EEG-based biometric authentication using gamma band (30-50 Hz) power during rest state computed using simple cross-correlation values of power spectral density features from 19 EEG channels. This technique offered an equal error rate (EER) of 0.0196 which is better than the state-of-the-art method employing eigenvector centrality features extracted from gamma band of 64 EEG channels of the same dataset (Springer CSSP 2018).

•	Proposed a biometric identification method using the frequently occurring maximum power spectral features derived from the 60-80 Hz band of resting state EEG signal. Power Spectral features derived from 109 subjects are used in this study and an equal error rate of 0.016 is obtained using only 10 EEG electrodes, which is better than the best method reported in literature using resting state EEG (IEEE ASPCON 2018). Further we proposed a novel feature called frequency-weighted power, which offers higher discrimination in the person identification compared to the state-of-the-art EEG features. The proposed method offered an equal error rate (EER) of 0.0039 from eyes-closed resting-state EEG signals using 20 electrodes, which is nearly one-fifth of the EER obtained by the best method reported in the literature for the comparable number of electrodes (IET Biometrics 2020).

•	Our recent work (BSPC July 2021-2) proposes a novel EEG-based biometric identification technique using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) acquired from two EEG electrodes. The proposed method employs single-trial familiar-name AEPs extracted from the frontal electrodes Fp1 and F7, which facilitates faster and user-convenient data acquisition. The EEG signals recorded from twenty healthy individuals during four experiment trials are used in this study. The cascaded combinations of 1D-convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) and with gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks gave the person identification accuracies above 99%. With the AEP signals from the single electrode Fp1, the same network achieves a person identification accuracy of 96.93 %.


7.	DROWSINESS DETECTION USING EEG

•	The ever-increasing fatality rate due to traffic and workplace accidents, resulting from drowsiness have been a persistent concern during the past years. An efficient technology capable of monitoring and detecting drowsiness can help to alleviate this concern and has potential applications in driver vigilance monitoring, vigilance monitoring in air traffic control rooms and other safety critical work places. We studied the feasibility of a wearable light weight wireless consumer grade Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based drowsiness detection (CMPB-February 2022). Muse headband with concurrent heart rate measurement was used for detecting drowsiness. An optimal set of EEG features that give maximum detection rate for the drowsy state, were derived. In addition, heart rate was also recorded concurrently with EEG and correlation between heart rate and the EEG features corresponding to drowsiness was also studied.

•	An EEG-based drowsiness detection algorithm, that can adapt to the inter-subject and intra-subject variabilities is proposed in our recent work (IEEE BioSMART 2021-1). Drowsiness detection was performed based on a simple thresholding algorithm in which, session dependent thresholds are predicted adaptively using a regression model. The proposed drowsiness detection was done using a consumer grade wearable headband ensuring user comfort and the algorithm yields a better detection accuracy of 85.01 % compared to conventional classifier-based approach (83.15%). The proposed adaptive thresholding algorithm can effectively be used for drowsiness detection and is suitable for real time drowsiness detection since the thresholds are determined adaptively.





8.	IMAGE AND VOICE FAMILIARITY DETECTION USING EEG

•	Detection of discriminative EEG features associated with presentation of familiar and non-familiar images is a topic of interest in criminal investigation, cognitive performance evaluation, etc. In our work (IEEE SMC 2015-3), we investigated a set of time-frequency based EEG features, while the subjects were exposed to familiar and unfamiliar visual stimuli (images) for a fixed time period during the experimental paradigm. The results showed that combination of features such as band power values, signal peaks, activity and mobility of the signal gives an average accuracy of 70.71% in classifying between familiar and unfamiliar images.

•	Feasibility of detecting familiar vs non-familiar voice (audio clips of people) signals using EEG signals was investigated in our work (IEEE SMC 2016-5). The results showed that combination of features such as mobility and complexity of the signal gives an average accuracy of 72.2% in classifying between familiar and unfamiliar voices. This is a pioneer work addressing the detection of voices of familiar people from EEG.

•	We conducted another pioneer work on investigating EEG discriminative features between familiar and unfamiliar names of people, presented in text format as visual stimuli. Detection of familiar and unfamiliar names can play a distinct role in psychology, clinical assessment of cognitive impairment, lie detection, investigations and interrogations. In this work, the subject’s familiarity to names of people was studied based on EEG signals obtained while the subjects were exposed to familiar and unfamiliar names as a visual stimulus in the form of text. The discriminative features were found to be subject-specific. Using three subject-specific features, an average classification accuracy of 84.37% for familiar vs. unfamiliar names was achieved.
